Hi there!, This is a second file created to exercise the use of github's "pushing" and "pulling" concepts.
This file will be pushed into the newbieMe branch of the repository HypnOS_Session.I am getting a hang of it.

This line is the second commit in this file. More commits to follow
This line is the third commit in this file.More commits to follow. stay tuned.

Lets add a realllllyyyyyyyyy long commit as commit 4 .Thats it .
So Today i practised git rebasing, this concept is of a very "should be avoided" kind of nature.It can lead tocatastrophic results if not done with very clear thinking about what is to done.Beginners are adviced not to play with this concept as it can create troubles for everybody else working on a project.And yes dont stress out yourself too much about this concept.Do experiment and try it out but not on public branches, do it on yourown branch.

This addition is just another exercise to understand the concept of commits.
